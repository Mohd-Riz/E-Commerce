# E-Commerce

This is a simple e-commerce website where you can add products and list them. 
The backend is built using Spring Boot, and MongoDB is used as the database, 
hosted in a Docker container via a Docker image. 
A simple frontend template was sourced from the internet and 
connected to the backend through APIs to fetch and display data from the database running in the Docker container.
